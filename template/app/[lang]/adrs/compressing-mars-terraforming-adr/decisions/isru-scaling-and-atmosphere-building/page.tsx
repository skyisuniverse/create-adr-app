                    Nanobots disassemble regolith at atomic scales, exponentially outperforming MOXIE 
                    (e.g., producing tons of O2/hour vs. grams). Breakthroughs in bio-nano interfaces allow 
                    hybrid systems: Nanobots fused with engineered microbes that photosynthesize under low light, 
                    converting CO2 to O2 at rates 1,000x faster than Earth's cyanobacteria.

                    - Resource Explosion (Years 3-4): Swarms of trillions of nanobots mine regolith for water
                    (from hydrated minerals), oxygen (via electrolysis), and methane fuel (Sabatier reaction 
                    enhanced by nano-catalysts). Self-replication turns a single lander into planetary-scale 
                    factories, producing habitats, solar farms, and propellant depots. Quantum AI simulates and 
                    optimizes extraction, yielding 99% efficiency with zero waste.

                    - Atmospheric Engineering (Years 4-6): Introduce super-greenhouse gases 
                    (e.g., nano-synthesized perfluorocarbons) for sustained warming, pushing 
                    pressure to 300-500 millibars. Bio-nano microbes, deployed in billions, begin 
                    oxygenation: Breakthrough genetic editing creates strains that thrive in the 
                    warming environment, generating O2 layers and ozone for UV protection. Nanobots 
                    seed artificial magnetospheres (via superconducting rings at Lagrange points) to 
                    shield against solar wind, retaining the new atmosphere.
