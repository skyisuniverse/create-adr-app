                    - Temperature and Pressure Increases: Releasing nanorods at a rate of ~30 liters per second 
                    (manufactured on-site from Martian dust) could raise global temperatures by more than 30 Kelvin 
                    (about 54°F) within months to years. This warming would melt polar ice caps and subsurface 
                    permafrost, releasing trapped CO2 and water vapor, thickening the atmosphere from its current 
                    ~6 millibars (0.6% of Earth's) toward levels supportive of liquid water (requiring ~6-10 millibars 
                    minimum pressure). Liquid water stability could emerge in low-lying regions like Hellas Planitia, 
                    enabling primitive ecosystems or agriculture in domed habitats.
