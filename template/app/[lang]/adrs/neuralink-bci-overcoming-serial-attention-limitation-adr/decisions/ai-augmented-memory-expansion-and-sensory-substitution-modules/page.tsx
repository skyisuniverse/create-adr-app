                    The brain is treated as a biological computer whose every experience (sight, sound, 
                    thought, emotion) is electrical signals. Neuralink's generalized I/O capability means:

                    - You could route multiple external data sources straight into visual/auditory/semantic 
                    cortices in parallel via sensory substitution (the same mechanism planned for Blindsight 
                    super-vision).

                    - AI handles the “training” workload — tokenizing, embedding, and cross-linking vast 
                    datasets — then writes the compressed understanding directly into expanded 
                    hippocampal/neocortical memory engrams.

                    - Subjectively, it feels like having 10-100 parallel minds that never sleep or lose 
                    bandwidth. You wake up each day having already “lived” through terabytes of curated 
                    information overnight.
