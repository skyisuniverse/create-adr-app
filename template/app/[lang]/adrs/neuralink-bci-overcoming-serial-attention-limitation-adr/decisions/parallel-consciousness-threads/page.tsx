                <Typography sx={{ marginBottom: 2 }}>
                    Building on early patient data showing cognitive compartmentalization (e.g., 
                    one implant user already multitasking pre-calc while controlling devices), 
                    future Neuralink designs could deliberately create divided attention streams:

                    Separate thread arrays in prefrontal, parietal, temporal, and sensory cortices 
                    run semi-independent “sub-consciousnesses.”

                <Typography sx={{ marginBottom: 2 }}>
                    One thread watches and deeply processes a physics lecture; another analyzes 
                    an X thread on AI ethics; a third ingests a novel — all simultaneously and 
                    without interference.

                    An overarching AI “conductor” layer stitches the parallel outputs into a 
                    unified meta-awareness when you want to reflect. Musk has already signaled 
                    the path: the first upgrade/dual-implant patient could appear as early as 
                    2026, and he expects Neuralink recipients to eventually surpass all 
                    unaugmented humans in reaction speed and cognitive throughput. Scaling this 
                    to full parallel streams is a direct extension.
