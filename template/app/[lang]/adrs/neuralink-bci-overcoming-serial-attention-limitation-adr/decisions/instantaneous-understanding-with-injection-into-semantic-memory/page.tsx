                    The BCI then injects pre-digested “concepts” directly into your semantic memory and 
                    working consciousness — not as sequential video/audio, but as instantaneous understanding,
                    insight clusters, or even simulated experiences. Result: you could “consume” 100 hours 
                    of content in subjective minutes, with full retention and cross-referencing, while your 
                    primary attention remains free for creative synthesis. Musk has explicitly described this 
                    as “uncompressed concepts” flowing between human minds and AI.
