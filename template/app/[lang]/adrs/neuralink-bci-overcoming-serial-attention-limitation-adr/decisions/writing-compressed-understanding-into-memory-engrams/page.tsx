                    AI handles the “training” workload — tokenizing, embedding, and cross-linking vast 
                    datasets — then writes the compressed understanding directly into expanded 
                    hippocampal/neocortical memory engrams.

                    - High-Throughput Nanomanipulation: Create parallel, automated systems for manipulating trillions of atoms simultaneously. Breakthrough: Scalable arrays of nanoscale probes (e.g., enhanced STM or AFM tips) that operate in 3D environments, not just 2D, with feedback loops for real-time correction. This would allow building volumetric structures like rocket tanks.

                <Typography sx={{ marginBottom: 2 }}>
                    - Atomic-Resolution Imaging in Dynamic Environments: Improve imaging to visualize and control reactions in real-time under ambient conditions (not just vacuum or cryo). Breakthrough: Next-gen scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) or electron microscopy with femtosecond resolution, integrated with AI for interpreting noisy data, enabling oversight of nanobot swarms during assembly.
