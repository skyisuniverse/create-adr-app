                    Grok 5 is a hypothetical next-generation model from xAI, projected to have around 6 trillion parameters with multimodal capabilities, based on industry trends for 2026 frontier models. For a baseline without breakthroughs, we estimate resources using data from similar models like Grok 4 (1.7T params, 310 GWh energy, $490M cost) and scaling up proportionally (assuming ~3.5x param increase leads to ~4-5x compute due to MoE efficiency and scaling laws). Training compute is estimated at ~1e27 FLOPs (6 * params * 20 * params for Chinchilla-optimal tokens, adjusted for MoE active params ~500B).

                    - <b>Time</b>: ~120 days (based on Grok 4's scale-up and typical frontier training runs).

                <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
                    - <b>Energy</b>: ~1.5 TWh (scaled from Grok 4's 310 GWh, accounting for larger scale and 1 GW clusters).
