                    Current tools like atomic force microscopes (AFM) can move single atoms, but they're slow 
                    and limited to surfaces.

                    - High-Throughput Nanomanipulation: Create parallel, automated systems for manipulating trillions of atoms simultaneously. Breakthrough: Scalable arrays of nanoscale probes (e.g., enhanced STM or AFM tips) that operate in 3D environments, not just 2D, with feedback loops for real-time correction. This would allow building volumetric structures like rocket tanks.

                <Typography sx={{ marginBottom: 2 }}>
                    - Atomic-Resolution Imaging in Dynamic Environments: Improve imaging to visualize and control reactions in real-time under ambient conditions (not just vacuum or cryo). Breakthrough: Next-gen scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) or electron microscopy with femtosecond resolution, integrated with AI for interpreting noisy data, enabling oversight of nanobot swarms during assembly.

                    <b>Photonic (Light-Based) Computing</b>: A key breakthrough could involve chips that use light beams instead of 
                    electricity to perform computations. For instance, engineers have developed programmable photonic chips 
                    capable of training nonlinear neural networks directly with light. This works by using a semiconductor 
                    material where a "pump" beam modulates a "signal" beam's behavior (<b>absorption, transmission, or amplification</b>), 
                    enabling real-time reconfiguration and nonlinear functions essential for deep learning. Such chips have 
                    demonstrated over 97% accuracy on classification tasks while using far less energy and fewer operations 
                    than electronic equivalents—potentially reducing AI data center power consumption by orders of magnitude 
                    and speeding up training through parallel optical processing. This could make training easier by eliminating 
                    heat management issues and enabling scalable, low-power systems.
