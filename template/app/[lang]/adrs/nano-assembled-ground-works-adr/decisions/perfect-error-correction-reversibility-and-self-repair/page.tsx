                    6. Perfect Error Correction, Reversibility, and Self-Repair

                    - Breakthrough needed: Atomic-scale error detection/correction (including radiation damage or thermal noise) with fully reversible operations and self-repair nanites embedded in every bot and final structure.

                    - Why required: Zero-defect foundations, flame trenches, and deluge systems are mandatory for Starship safety; any error in soft coastal soil must be instantly fixed without downtime.
