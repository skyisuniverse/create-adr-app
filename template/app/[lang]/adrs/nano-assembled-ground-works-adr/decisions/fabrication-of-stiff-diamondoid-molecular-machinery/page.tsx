                    2. Fabrication of Stiff, Low-Friction Diamondoid (or Superior) Molecular Machinery

                <Typography sx={{ marginBottom: 2 }}>
                    - Breakthrough needed: Reliable synthesis and assembly of rigid, vacuum-tight, low-friction diamondoid (or carbyne/graphene-hybrid) structures at the nanoscale, including molecular motors, bearings, gears, tooltips, and sensor arrays that function reliably in liquid or soil.
                </Typography>

                <Typography sx={{ marginBottom: 2 }}>
                    - Why required: Nanobots must withstand mechanical forces during excavation/transport while embedding active elements (phononic bandgaps, molecular pumps, vibration actuators) into the final Starbase structures. Soft DNA/protein machines (current state) would fail under load or in soil.
                </Typography>

                <Typography sx={{ marginBottom: 2 }}>
                    - Status (2026): Conceptual designs and small molecular machines exist; no diamondoid components.
