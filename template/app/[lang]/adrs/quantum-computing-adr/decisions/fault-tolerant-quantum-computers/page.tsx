                    <b>Quantum Computing</b>: Quantum systems could accelerate AI training through parallel processing 
                    of complex optimizations, such as matrix operations in deep learning. Algorithms like Quantum 
                    Approximate Optimization (QAOA) or Variational Quantum Eigensolvers (VQE) might fine-tune models 
                    faster than classical methods, potentially handling exponentially larger datasets. Hybrid quantum-AI 
                    approaches, where quantum processors pre-process data for classical ML, have shown promise in reducing 
                    training data needs and speeding up convergence. While current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) 
                    devices limit scale, <b>fault-tolerant quantum computers</b> could provide exponential speedups for tasks like 
                    gradient descent, making training easier for problems intractable on classical hardware.
