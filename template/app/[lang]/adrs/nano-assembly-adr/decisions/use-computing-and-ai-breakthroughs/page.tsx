                    - Quantum Computing for Simulations: Simulate molecular interactions for entire Starship
                    designs at atomic fidelity. Current supercomputers can't handle the complexity.
                    Breakthrough: Fault-tolerant quantum computers with millions of qubits, running
                    algorithms to model mechanosynthesis pathways and predict emergent properties.

                    - AI-Driven System Design: Automate the blueprinting of nanobot behaviors and assembly sequences.
                    Breakthrough: Advanced AI (e.g., integrating machine learning with genetic algorithms) that designs
                    self-replicating systems, optimizes for efficiency, and incorporates error correction codes, drawing
                    from structural biology.

                <Typography sx={{ marginBottom: 2 }}>
                    - Swarm Intelligence Algorithms: Coordinate trillions of nanobots without central failure points.
                    Breakthrough: Decentralized control systems using bio-inspired algorithms (e.g., ant colonies) or
                    quantum entanglement for communication, ensuring synchronized assembly over large areas.
