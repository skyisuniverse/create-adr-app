                    MNT relies on "exotic" materials that don't exist yet for assemblers and products.

                    - Diamondoid and Stiff Nanostructures: Engineer ultra-rigid, low-friction materials (e.g., carbon-based diamondoids) for nanobot components to withstand thermal vibrations (Brownian motion). Breakthrough: Synthesis of large-scale diamondoid lattices via MNT itself, providing the stiffness needed for precise atomic placement without deformation.

                <Typography sx={{ marginBottom: 2 }}>
                    - Self-Healing and Adaptive Materials: Develop nanomaterials that repair assembly errors autonomously. For Starship, this means heat shields or engines that self-correct defects. Breakthrough: Integration of smart polymers or nanocomposites that respond to stimuli (e.g., heat, light) for in-situ repairs, scaling from lab demos to industrial volumes.

                <Typography sx={{ marginBottom: 2 }}>
                    - Novel Feedstock Processing: Efficiently extract and purify atoms from raw sources (e.g., air, soil) without energy waste. Breakthrough: Nanoscale refineries that disassemble molecules selectively, producing pure elemental streams for assembly.
