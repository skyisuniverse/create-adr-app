                    - Stacking the Stages: Once components are ready, larger "macro-bots" 
                    (assembled from nanobot clusters) lift and mate the Starship onto the booster. 
                    Molecular bonding ensures a seamless join, stronger than mechanical clamps.

                    - System-Wide Integration: Bots weave in cross-stage connections like umbilicals 
                    and data lines. Fuel systems are tested by simulating flows at the molecular level.

                    - Quality Assurance: A diagnostic swarm scans the entire vehicle, atom by atom, 
                    for defects. Any flaws are disassembled and rebuilt instantly. AI simulations run 
                    virtual stress tests, incorporating real-time material data.
