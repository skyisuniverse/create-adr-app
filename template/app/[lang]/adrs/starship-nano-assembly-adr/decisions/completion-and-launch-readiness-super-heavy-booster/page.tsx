                    - Fueling and Activation: With the structure complete, bots could even produce 
                    and load propellants—synthesizing methane from carbon and hydrogen, and liquefying 
                    oxygen from the air—directly into the tanks.

                <Typography sx={{ marginBottom: 2 }}>
                    - Post-Assembly: The nanobot swarm deactivates or disassembles itself, recycling 
                    into storage for future use. The finished Starship stands ready, potentially in a 
                    fraction of the time and cost of today's methods (e.g., weeks instead of months, with 
                    no supply chain dependencies).

                <Typography sx={{ marginBottom: 2 }}>
                    - Scalability: This tech could enable mass production: replicate the process for 
                    fleets of Starships, or even assemble them in space using asteroid-derived materials.

                    This scenario leverages MNT's strengths—precision, efficiency, and adaptability—to make 
                    Starship assembly as routine as printing a document. However, challenges like managing 
                    heat dissipation during rapid assembly or preventing unintended replication would need 
                    robust safeguards. In practice, early versions might hybridize with current tech, like 
                    using nanobots for critical components while traditionally building the bulk structure. 
                    If we achieve this, it could accelerate space colonization by making mega-rockets 
                    abundant and customizable.
