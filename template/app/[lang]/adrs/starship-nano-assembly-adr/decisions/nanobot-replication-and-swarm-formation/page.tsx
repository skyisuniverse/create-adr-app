                <Typography sx={{ marginBottom: 2 }}>
                    - Exponential Scaling: The seed nanobots begin self-replicating using the 
                    feedstock. Each bot assembles copies of itself by precisely placing atoms to form 
                    stiff diamondoid structures (carbon-based lattices stronger than steel). This phase 
                    is exponential: starting with millions, the swarm could grow to trillions in hours, 
                    limited only by energy and material supply.

                <Typography sx={{ marginBottom: 2 }}>
                    - Coordination Setup: The swarm organizes into specialized teams via wireless 
                    quantum entanglement or chemical signaling. An AI "conductor" oversees the process, 
                    assigning tasks and monitoring for errors (e.g., using built-in quantum error 
                    correction to counter thermal vibrations).
                </Typography>

                <Typography sx={{ marginBottom: 2 }}>
                    - Site Preparation: A subset of bots clears and levels the assembly area, perhaps 
                    building a temporary scaffold from self-assembling polymers to support the growing 
                    structure.
